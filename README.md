# Motor_Vehcile_Collisions

A database made with a team of classmates for our INST327 final project. The data we chose to analyze was motor vehicle collsuions in the state of New York. With over 500 rows of data, we aimed to analyze key factors that may influenced these collsions such vehicle type, vehicle make, and sex of driver. The goal of our database was to view potential of these collisions and use those trands as a means to prevent collisions in the future.

Attached to this repository are four files:

Team Project Final Submission: A final report of our database. Includes our thoughts on choosing our data, logical and physical design of our database, and ethical considerations we took.
